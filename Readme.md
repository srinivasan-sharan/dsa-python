DSA practice, everyday, from the bottom

##### Timeline
_02/01_ 
basics started

_04/01_
understands recursion, but needs to learn how to implement it well in any given problem, basically be able to use it effectively. Also started backtracking using recursion.

_06/01_
the earlier learnt method (parametric??) was kinda weird and clashed with previously learnt method of implementing it, which is why there was a bit of confusion, now it is better.
have to go ahead with the functional style, looks cooler, works better(this statement is debatable)


_12/01_
will change the approach and try to implement each data structure and algorithm from scratch, maybe better understand them that way? (can be totally sub optimal who knows). clrs, i come to you again after 5 years
